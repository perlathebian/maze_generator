##Note
This is my first time working with Android Studio or creating an Android app; I just thought it would be interesting to try something new. If there are some loopholes, I have created another version of this maze generator using the tools I'm more familiar with (Maven, Java, JavaFX) in IntelliJ, that I can show upon request. Thank you for your time!
